#One-Pager
About a year ago my partners at Influx and I released One-Pager, a free template for library websites.

We've updated it and it is better than ever. In fact, good implementations of One-Pager will be better than most library websites.

With this update the code is cleaner and more efficient, and we've added some responsive elements so that it formats well on any browser. Check out what happens on a mobile device. The image disappears and the menu adapts so that the most important tasks can be taken care of easily.

One-Pager is intentionally different than most library websites. Try out the demo and read more about the ideas behind [One-Pager on Influx's site](http://influx.us/onepager).
